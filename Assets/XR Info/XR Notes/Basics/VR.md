### Introduction
Virtual Reality (VR) technology immerses users in a fully digital environment, creating a simulated experience that can mimic or differ entirely from the real world.

## Etymology
"Virtual" has had the meaning of "being something in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact" since the mid-1400s.
The term "virtual" has been used in the computer sense of "not physically existing but made to appear by software since 1959.
