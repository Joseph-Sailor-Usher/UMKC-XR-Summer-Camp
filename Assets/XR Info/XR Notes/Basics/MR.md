### Introduction
Mixed reality (MR) refers to the merging of a real-world environment and a computer-generated one, where physical and virtual objects co-exist and interact in real time.

### Key Concepts
- **Visuo-Haptic Mixed Reality:** Mixed reality that incorporates haptic feedback.
- **Interreality Systems:** Virtual reality systems coupled with their real-world counterparts, exhibiting dual reality or mixed reality states.

### Display Technologies and Products
#### Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE)
- **Description:** A room-sized environment with projected displays for immersive simulations.
- **Applications:** Engineering prototypes, microscopic environments, and factory floor simulations.

#### Head-Up Display (HUD)
- **Description:** Projects imagery directly in front of the viewer without obstructing their view.
- **Applications:** Aviation, automotive navigation, and more.

#### Head-Mounted Display ([[HMD]])
- **Description:** Worn over the head or in front of the eyes, projecting images for immersive experiences.
- **Applications:** Medicine, entertainment, engineering, and aviation.

#### Mobile Devices
- **Description:** Smartphones and tablets with AR capabilities.
- **Applications:** Gaming (e.g., Pok√©mon GO), navigation, and translation.

### Blended Spaces
- **Definition:** Spaces where physical and virtual environments are closely integrated.
- **Key Components:** Input and notifications linking the physical and digital spaces.
- **Examples:** AR devices like Microsoft HoloLens, smart meeting rooms, and tourism apps.
