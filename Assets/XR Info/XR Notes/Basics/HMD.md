### Introduction
A head-mounted display (HMD) is a device that allows a user to interact with a virtual world by wearing it on their head. It typically includes small high-resolution screens for each eye, providing stereoscopic 3D graphics and immersive experiences in [[VR]] and [[AR]].

### Components of HMD

- **Displays:** Two small high-resolution OLED or LCD monitors for stereoscopic graphics.
- **Audio System:** Binaural audio system for 3D sound.
- **Tracking Systems:** Positional and rotational real-time head tracking for six degrees of movement.
- **Motion Controls:** Controllers with haptic feedback for interacting with the virtual world.
- **Omnidirectional Treadmills:** Allows users to walk in any direction within the virtual environment.

### Key Technologies

- **Stereoscopic Displays:** Separate images for each eye to create a 3D effect.
- **Binaural Audio:** Spatial audio that provides directional sound cues.
- **Head Tracking:** Sensors that track head movements in real-time.
- **Haptic Feedback:** Technology that simulates touch by applying forces, vibrations, or motions to the user.

### Applications of HMD

- **Entertainment:** Video games, virtual reality experiences, and 3D movies.
- **Education and Training:** Medical simulations, military training, and flight simulators.
- **Business:** Virtual meetings, product design, and architectural visualization.
- **Therapy and Rehabilitation:** Treatment for PTSD, phobias, and physical rehabilitation exercises.

### Examples of HMD

- **Oculus Rift:** One of the first consumer-grade VR headsets.
- **HTC Vive:** Known for its room-scale VR and precise tracking.
- **PlayStation VR:** A popular HMD for gaming on the PlayStation console.
- **Microsoft HoloLens:** A mixed reality headset that overlays digital content onto the real world.

### Health and Safety Concerns

- **Motion Sickness:** Caused by a disconnect between visual input and physical sensations.
- **Eyestrain:** Due to prolonged use of screens close to the eyes.
- **Physical Injuries:** Risk of collisions and falls while using the HMD in an uncontrolled environment.
- **Privacy Issues:** Data collection and tracking of user movements and interactions.
