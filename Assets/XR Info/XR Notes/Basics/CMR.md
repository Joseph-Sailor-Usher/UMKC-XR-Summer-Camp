### Introduction
CMR (Computer-mediated reality) refers to the ability to add to, subtract information from, or otherwise manipulate one's perception of reality through the use of a wearable computer or hand-held device such as a smartphone or an [[HMD]].

### Components of Computer-Mediated Reality
- **Wearable Computers:** Devices like the EyeTap that alter the visual input stream.
- **Hand-Held Devices:** Smartphones and tablets that use cameras and screens to overlay digital content onto the real world.
- **Software:** Applications that process and alter the visual input to enhance or diminish reality.

### Key Concepts
- **Mediated Reality:** A superset of mixed reality, augmented reality, and virtual reality, which also includes diminished reality.
- **Visual Perception:** Typically, the user's visual perception of the environment is mediated through electronic devices.
- **Applications:** Enhancing visual perception for the visually impaired, interactive computer interfaces, and architectural applications.

### History
- **1970s-1980s:** Steve Mann introduced the Generation-1 and Generation-2 "Digital Eye Glass" as a vision aid and general-purpose seeing aid.

### Key Technologies
- **EyeTap Devices:** Wearable devices that act as visual filters between the real world and what the user perceives.
- **Smartphones:** Use cameras to capture real-world data and display altered or enhanced content on the screen.
- **Reality Window Manager:** A common window manager in mediated reality systems.

### Applications of Computer-Mediated Reality
- **Healthcare and Medicine:**
    - **Surgery:** Virtual reality simulations for training, error reduction, and pre-surgery modeling.
    - **Neurodegenerative Diseases:** Virtual reality for memory training and patient monitoring.
    - **Electronic Consultation:** Services like Teladoc for remote medical consultations.
- **Video Games:**
    - **Virtual Reality Headsets:** Devices like Oculus Rift that immerse the user's vision in the game world.
    - **Augmented Reality Games:** Pok√©mon Go, Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, and Ingress, which overlay game elements onto the real world.
- **Social Media:** AR lenses in apps like Snapchat that add 3D objects or alter appearances in photos, including beauty filters.

### Health and Safety Concerns
- **Eyestrain:** Short-term effects such as eyestrain caused by prolonged use of mediated reality devices.
- **Long-Term Effects:** Potential negative side effects of long-term exposure have not been thoroughly studied.

### Examples of Mediated Reality Devices
- **EyeTap Devices:** Developed by Steve Mann for enhancing visual perception.
- **Smartphones:** Commonly used for AR applications and visual enhancement.

### Research and Development
- **Architectural Applications:** Use of mediated reality to diminish perception by removing or masking visual data.
- **Ongoing Research:** Exploration of new applications and improvements in mediated reality technologies.
