## Learning Approach

1. **Project-Based Learning:** Hands-on projects to apply theoretical knowledge.
2. **Collaborative Learning:** Group activities and sharing sessions to enhance peer learning.
3. **Adaptive Learning:** Customized assignments and tasks based on individual progress and interest.
4. **Reflective Practice:** Encouraging students to reflect on their experiences and learning process.

We aim to create an engaging and supportive environment where students can explore, create, and innovate in the field of XR technology.
